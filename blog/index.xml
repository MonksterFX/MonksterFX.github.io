      <description>why german utf-8 is broken The programming world most of the time does not really care about characters which are special in other languages others than englisch. So in Germany we have our all time favorites ÄÖÜäüöß to take care about everytime we work with text documents.
Normally you will have no trouble with text editors, but an burning example is Microsoft Office. To correctly import an utf-8 encoded csv document (with special chars) you have to provide an BOM.</description>

      <description>convert bson timestamp to date So I&amp;rsquo;m used to create a timestamp for logging in the db when something is created. What should go wrong with using mongo bson timestamp. Let me say it this way. As long as you leave it alone in the database it will happily coexist with all the other stuff.
But if you want to use it in javascript it gets complicated.

      <description>CC or CoffeinChat In a project im working on I recently got asked how we could implement a chat by ourselfs. We work a lot with GCP in this Project an so the first tough was to implement it with the help of firebase.
But because of the ongoing debate about GDPR we skipped the easy way and tough about the critical stuff in a chat: The live reload aka pushing news to the client.</description>

      <description>the problem If you want to disable your root user of the maschine being accessed via SSH you probably ran into Problems with SFTP on your server. As long you use the root user of the maschine your SFTP will work fine, but if you change your user you will get into trouble.
I&amp;rsquo;m working a lot with docker and bind mounts for config files so I can&amp;rsquo;t change the owner/permission of the directory or file I&amp;rsquo;m binding to.</description>

      <description>extract only subset of embedded documents Sometimes we want to extract not all embedded documents from a matched documents. Imagine a object chatroom:
{ _id: ObjectId(&#39;5f687ba6a93aeddc476ea157&#39;), ... messages: Array&amp;lt;Messages&amp;gt; }  The messages look like this:
{ sender: Reference, send_at: Date payload: &amp;quot;&amp;quot; }  Now when we want to extract all message before, after a date we could query the Chatroom and filter it in the backend logic, or we can use Aggregation Pipeline.</description>
